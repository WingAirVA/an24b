QUICK STARTUP-GUIDE (to be improved (with pictures (and such (like, as pdf))))

- On AZS(circuit-breaker)-Panel (big panel with MANY switches at right side of crewsection):
  - Close ALL circuit-breakers (best by clicking the "all-on"-clickspots to the right of each row)

- On Fuel-Control-Panel (extra-panel on pilots' middle panel):
  - Turn on all switches at the bottom, except middle one (cross-feed, optional)

- On Left Horizontal Console:
  - Turn up TG-16 APU cut-off switch next to green and red lamps

- On Engine-Start-Panel (sunk panel on pilot's left console):
  - Press TG-16 APU Start button, wait for TG-16 run-up, indicated by green lamp and tachometer
  - Put Engine select switch to "Left" and Press AI-24 Engine Start button
    - left engine should spool up and start
  - Put Engine select switch to "Right" and Press AI-24 Engine Start button
    - guess what's supposed to happen!
  - Press Discontinue TG-16 Start, APU stops

- On Left Horizontal Console:
  - Turn down cut-off switch next to green and red lamps

- Below pilot's left panel:
  - Put on switches "AGD", "EUP", "CGV"; watch left AGD (AI) and EUP spin up

- Below F/O's right panel:
  - Put on switches "AGD", "GIK", "GPK"; watch right AGD (AI) and compasses spin up

- On pilot's left panel:
  - Press GIK Fast Alignment button below AI until indicator of KPPM (HSI) doesn't move anymore

- On F/O's right console:
  - Look out for a big compass rose and a device with two knobs above it
  - Set latitude on right knob and use left knob to turn big compass rose to heading indicated by KPPM

- On middle console:
  - Put on second switch of AP-control, wait for orange light ("AP ready")

- Below pilot's left panel: 
  - Left 3-way switch: choose appropriate steering setting (up: taxi, middle: OFF, down: takeoff/landing) 

- In GUI "an24b":
  - Select "Realism setting" and/or "Tiller steering"

QUICK IMPORTANT INSTRUMENTS GUIDE

- SPU-7 Communication device:
  - Located at all four workplaces; what and who you listen to on your headphones, who you speak to on your mic (workplace specific)
  - "General"-volume knob adjusts volume of SELECTED "SPU"- (=Intercomm) or "Radio"- (=selected source) mode
  - "Listen"-volume knob adjusts volume of NOT selected "SPU"- or "Radio"-mode
  - set desired source on central knob:
    - "UKR" and "DR": R-802 I* and R-802 II*; VHF
    - "SR" and "KR": US-8k*, R-836*; HF/VHF
    - "RK1" and "RK2": Radiocompass ARK-11 I*, Radiocompass ARK-11 II*/RSBN
* Current configuration 

- R-802 VHF
  - Located middle overhead left (I) and right (II) side; I is memory device, II is frequency select device
    - Turn one or both R-802 power switches (overhead) to position "ON"
    - Turn up volume knob
    - Set desired frequency on II, store this frequency in I by clicking screw in I -> frequency will be stored in I at currently set channel*
    - Set channel on I, click screw on II -> II will tune to currently selected channel on I*
* Not as in RL; in RL, memory of I is "programmed" preflight and has no influence to II nor is influenced by II
    
- ARK-11 ADF:
  - I and II located at Navigator's workplace, second I on overhead; like R-802 with memory device (buttons 1-9)
    - Push down the upper "P"-button from the left section of memory buttons -> device now ready to set frequencies
    - Set desired frequency by left knob: frequency ranges, middle one: rough setting, right upper one: fine tuning
    - Push one memory button 1-9 to store frequency*; station, frequency and range should appear on table; repeat as desired
    - With "P"-button pushed again (up), pressing memory buttons will "recall" set frequencies
  - ARK-11 modes:
    - "Comp. 1" and "Comp. 2": like "ADF" mode, frame/loop antenna turns automatically, to/from known
    - "Ant.": guess!
    - "Frame": manual turning of frame/loop antenna by l-r-antenna switch, volume and instrument above indicate direction, to/from unknown
  - You can switch between the navigator's and the pilots' (overhead) control panel by pressing the lower right button
* Not as in RL; see R-802

- AP-28l1 Autopilot
  - Located at back of middle console
  - Power on by, well, "AP Power ON"
  - Connect by either pressing "d" or big button -> Wing level* and Pitch Hold will connect first
  - Disconnect by pressing "d" again
  - Some transfers from one mode to another need pressing big button again
  - In "GIK Roll Mode", Heading can be controlled by knob of ZK
* Should be Roll Hold I think?

- Anti-Ice System
  - On F/O's right console: PPD pitot and static port heating; up position: ON; middle: OFF; down: control
    - Left switch: Pitot A1 (pilot's KUS-730) and static ports S1 and S5 (pilot's KUS-730, VAR-30 and UVO-15)
    - Middle switch: Pitot A2 (FDR and emergency pitot for A1) and static port S3 (FDR)
    - Right switch: Pitot A3 (F/O's KUS-730) and static ports S2 and S6 (F/O's KUS-730, VAR-30 and UVID-15 and UVPD-15)
    - Upper switch: Static ports S4 and S7 (altitude correction KV-11)
  - At bottom of F/O's right panel:
    - 2x right window (low and intense); astrocompass*; wing, tail and nose; prop hub and blades
  - At bottom of pilot's left panel:
    - 2x right window (low and intense)
* not on this plane!

- Pitot and Static Port Pressure valves
  - On pilot's left console:
    - Back one: A1 -> A2*
    - Front one: S1 and S5* -> E1 (emergency port in radar chamber)
  - On F/O's right console (one red lever):
    - S2 and S6* -> E2 (emergency port in radar chamber)
* also see "Anti-Ice System"
